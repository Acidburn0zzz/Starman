NAME
    Nomo - High-performance preforking PSGI web server

SYNOPSIS
      # Run app.psgi with the default settings
      > nomo

      # run with Server::Starter
      > start_server --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- nomo --max-servers 32 myapp.psgi

      # UNIX domain sockets
      > nomo --listen /tmp/nomo.sock

DESCRIPTION
    Nomo is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

    High Performance
        Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

    Preforking
        Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.
        Nomo also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the worker
        pool.

    Signals
        Supports "HUP" for graceful restarts, and "TTIN"/"TTOU" to
        dynamically increase or decrease the number of worker processes.

    Superdaemon aware
        Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

    Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support
        Able to listen on multiple intefaces including UNIX sockets.

    PSGI compatible
        Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

    HTTP/1.1 support
        Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
        requests.

PERFORMANCE
    A simple benchmark using "Hello.psgi" as of Plack git SHA *82121a* with
    ApacheBench concurrenty 10 and Keep-alive on.
