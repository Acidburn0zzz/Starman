NAME
    Nomo - High-performance preforking PSGI web server

SYNOPSIS
      # Run app.psgi with the default settings
      > nomo

      # run with Server::Starter
      > start_server --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- nomo --max-servers 32 myapp.psgi

      # UNIX domain sockets
      > nomo --listen /tmp/nomo.sock

DESCRIPTION
    Nomo is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

    High Performance
        Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

    Preforking
        Runs servers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.

    Superdaemon aware
        Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

    UNIX Domain Socket support
        Forked children share the UNIX domain socket with the parent process
        for the best performance when used with the nginx proxy in front.

    PSGI compatible
        Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

    HTTP/1.1 support
        Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
        requests.
