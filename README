NAME
    Nomo - High performance, starter-aware and preforking PSGI web server

SYNOPSIS
      # preforking HTTP server
      % nomo --max-workers 20 app.psgi

      # run with Server::Starter superdaemon
      % server_starter --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- nomo --max-workers 32 app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Nomo is a collection of unique Web servers, that are:

    High Performance
        Heavily uses XS to use C extensions to parse XS headers and use
        sendfile(2) to serve static files if available.

    Preforking
        Runs servers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.
        This means your applications are preloaded to be copy-on-write
        friendly.

    Superdaemon aware
        Automatically detect superdaemon such as Server::Starter and
        ControlFreak for hot-deploy and UNIX socket sharing.

    PSGI compatible
        Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks.

NOMO?
    The name Nomo is taken from the baseball player <Hideo Nomo>, who is a
    great starter, famous for his forkball and whose nickname is Tornado.
